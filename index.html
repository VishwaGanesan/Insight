                            Students feel difficult to choose the right career path after completing their schooling. In many circumstances, students select their career based on the marks and external opinions. And after going to the college they struggle a lot to sustain in the stream they have chosen.
                            This web application mainly concentrates on the students who have completed their high school and are to go for higher studies. In this application we conduct a test known as RAISEC test. In this we use the questions which are created by John Holland. In this test, fortytwo  questions will be asked. Based on the responses, the studentâ€™s interests and willingness are evaluated. Based on this, certain suggestions are given to the students that help them in choosing their ideal stream.

                            The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes (RIASEC) refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice (based upon personality types) that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland.
    
                            The US Department of Labor ETA has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the "Interests" section of its free online database, The Occupational Information Network (O*NET) since its inception during the late 1990s.
                        <h2>Instructions for test</h2>
